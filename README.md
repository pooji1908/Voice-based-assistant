# Voice-based-assistant

This Python application utilizes speech recognition and text generation to create an interactive voice assistant. Users can issue voice commands, which are processed to provide responses using OpenAI's GPT model. The assistant can perform tasks such as opening websites (e.g., YouTube, Google) and responding to queries audibly.


**Voice Command Recognition**: Listen and interpret user queries through the microphone.
**Text Generation**: Leverage OpenAI's API to generate context-aware responses.
**Web Navigation**: Open specified websites based on user requests.
**Text-to-Speech**: Speak the responses for an engaging user experience.


#Requirements

2. __Required libraries:__ speech_recognition, pyttsx3, openai, python-dotenv

Make sure to set up your environment and provide your OpenAI API key in a .env file.
